# Oneidy Constanza Garcia

🚀 Full-Stack + Machine Learning Engineer focused on building production-ready AI systems.

I design and ship end-to-end ML-powered applications — from model integration and API design to responsive front-end experiences and cloud deployment. My work emphasizes clean architecture, real-world usability, and scalable system design.

## 🧠 What I Build

- 🔹 ML-powered APIs (Flask/FastAPI) with robust endpoints and testing  
- 🔹 Full-stack AI applications (React/Next.js + Python backends)  
- 🔹 Embedding and transformer-based systems (Hugging Face, SentenceTransformers)  
- 🔹 Cloud-ready pipelines (Azure, Supabase, SQL)  
- 🔹 Production-minded architecture with clear documentation
